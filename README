I'm creating issues on here for things that need to be done. I'll be gone until thursday, but will have the entire evening to work on things and finish the project.

If you guys can work on it at some point and get one or two of the issues taken care of that would be awesome.

--Getting a single server/client running

1. clone the repo, duhhh
2. navigate one directory outside the repo (so if you have your repo in ~/chatosaur, you want to be in ~/)
3. run java chatosaur.server.Server to get the server started
4. do option one to get the server running on a port

5. navigate to that directory in another window and run java chatosaur.client.Client
6. use host=localhost and port=[the port you specified above]
7. you should now be chatting!

8. the server creates a log file "server_[port].log" you can tail to see what's going on

--Adding another server:

1. open a new window and run chatosaur.server.Server like before
2. hit option 1 and start the server on a different port
3. once the server is running hit option 2 on the OTHER server and enter in 'localhost' and the port of the new server to add it
4. if all goes well you should see the updated list propagate in the log to the new server.

--Compiling

I have just been using a text editor to work on this thing, but feel free to create a new branch and make a netbeans/eclipse project or w/e.

To compile the server run:

    javac chatosaur/server/*.java

To compile the client run:

    javac chatosaur/client/*.java

(remember to be one directory up from the repo again)
